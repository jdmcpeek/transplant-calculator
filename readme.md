In medicine, the best way to predict a patient's survival is often to look at the survival of similar patients in the past. This is challenging for diseases/conditions that are rare, bc doctors may have seen only a few (or zero) similar patients in the past. In these cases, performing searches on a database that aggregates many different doctors' patients is helpful. This web app is an easy way to search an existing database of pediatric heart and lung transplant recipients to see how different types of patients differ in survival.
